 üíæ Flashing & Recovery Methods

 SD Card / eMMC Flashing

1. Download desired `.img` or `.img.gz` image.
2. Flash with [Balena Etcher] or Win32 Disk Imager.

 USB Maskrom Recovery (Bricked Devices)
1. Enter MaskROM mode with NanoPi R2S Plus (hold MASK button, plug USB-C).
2. Use `tools/RKDevTool`:
   - Select `update.img` (or config for partition set)
   - Click ‚ÄúUpgrade‚Äù or ‚ÄúExecute‚Äù
3. Wait for completion; remove cable and reboot.

> Tip: For easy installation to eMMC, use eFlasher SD images and follow the web GUI instructions.



 üìà Troubleshooting & Tips

- If a flash tool reports "Firmware load failed", check the image type: only `update.img` or partitioned images are valid for RKDevTool.
- SD boot not working? Try another card, re-burn image, or verify power supply.
- For full system backup/restore, use provided scripts in `/backup`.



 üí¨ FAQ

- Where do I get the latest firmware?  
  See the [firmware/](firmware/) folder, updated monthly.
- Can I build custom packages?  
  Yes! Use the SDK and our helper scripts.
- My device is bricked‚Äîwhat now?  
  Detailed MaskROM + eFlasher recovery steps are in [docs/RECOVERY.md](docs/RECOVERY.md).
